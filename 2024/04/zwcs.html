            <p>I haven’t seen my father for over two years, and the image that lingers in my mind is his retreating figure. One winter, following the death of my grandmother and the loss of his job, tragedy seemed to follow us closely. I traveled from Beijing to Xuzhou, planning to join my father and return home for the funeral. Arriving in Xuzhou, the sight of our disheveled home and the memories of my grandmother brought tears to my eyes. My father comforted me, saying, “Things are as they are, there’s no use being sad. Fortunately, every cloud has a silver lining.”</p>
<p>We sold assets and pawned items to pay off debts and fund the funeral expenses. Those days were bleak, half overshadowed by the funeral and half by my father’s unemployment. After the funeral, my father planned to look for work in Nanjing while I was to return to Beijing to continue my studies. We decided to travel together to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Nanjing, a friend invited me to explore the city, which delayed our plans by a day. The next morning, we needed to cross the river to Pukou and I was to catch a train to Beijing in the afternoon. Busy with his own matters, my father initially decided not to see me off and arranged for a familiar waiter from the hotel to accompany me. Despite his detailed instructions to the waiter, his concern led him to change his mind, and he decided to accompany me after some hesitation. Although I was already twenty and had traveled to Beijing alone before, he still insisted, saying, “It’s better if I go with you.”</p>
<p>At the station, while I purchased the ticket, he managed our numerous bags, needing to tip the porters to help us. I, thinking myself clever, often felt his manner of speaking lacked finesse and frequently interrupted him. However, he managed to negotiate the price and helped me onto the train, choosing a seat by the door for me and laying out the purple wool coat he had given me. He reminded me to be cautious, stay awake during the night, and not to catch a cold, reiterating his instructions to the waiter to take good care of me. Secretly, I found his worries overly cautious; those men were only interested in money, and at my age, surely I could look after myself. Now, reflecting back, I realize I was perhaps too arrogant.</p>
<p>As I urged him to leave, he went to buy some oranges, advising me to stay put. He laboriously made his way across the railway tracks and struggled to climb onto the platform. Watching his bulky figure, dressed in a black cap and overcoat with a deep blue cotton robe, slowly navigating the obstacles, I was suddenly overwhelmed with emotion and my tears flowed freely. By the time he returned, orange in hand, I quickly composed myself, not wanting him or others to see my tears.</p>
<p>He brushed off his coat and seemed relieved as he placed the oranges on my lap, then told me he would write as soon as he arrived in Nanjing. Watching him leave, I felt a surge of emotion as his figure blended into the crowd and disappeared. Once he was out of sight, I sat down, and my tears returned.</p>
<p>In recent years, both my father and I have been busy, with the situation at home worsening by the day. Despite his early achievements, his later years seemed marked by decline. This weighed heavily on his spirit, often resulting in outbursts over minor domestic issues. Our relationship changed, but in the last two years, he seemed to forget my past mistakes and focused only on his concern for me and my son. After moving to Beijing, he wrote to me mentioning his poor health and anticipating his time was running short. In the shimmering tears, I again saw his figure in the blue cotton robe and black overcoat. Oh, how I long to see him again!</p>
<p>October 1925, Beijing.</p>
